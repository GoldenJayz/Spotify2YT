# Spotify2YT
Have you ever wanted to convert your Spotify playlist to a YouTube playlist so you can avoid ads? Well that is what I did here. I mostly find music on Spotify but I usually listen to my songs on YouTube so I don't have to listen to those stupid Spotify Ads. I did not feel like putting every song in my Spotify playlist in a YouTube playlist manually so I just made an app to do it for me.

# Setup

1. Create a Spotify Dev Account

2. Add a callback URI and copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the corresponding variables inside the code
3. Headover to this link https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=youtube
4. Create a project and once you are done setting up the credentials click the button
5. Place the JSON file in your working directory and rename it client_secret.json
6. Then just run the program :)
